This study aims to compare the performance of three portfolio allocation methods --- Markowitz, Equal Weight, and Risk Parity --- using B3 asset data from 2018 to 2019. Portfolio evaluation employed the Sharpe Ratio, which measures return adjusted for total risk, and the Sortino Ratio, focusing specifically on downside risk. The study adopts a quantitative, descriptive, and comparative approach, utilizing computational tools for portfolio optimization and performance analysis. The results aim to provide relevant insights for investors operating in high volatility markets such as Brazil.
